> **This project is currently under development and is not feature complete.**

Checkily Chess Engine is a personal endeavor born out of a curiosity about the inner workings of the algorithms driving the decision-making processes of chess engines.
The primary goal is to implement a simple and understandable chess engine in C++, and not to compete against sophisticated engines.

The project is split into:
- [`chess`](https://github.com/nikolausrauch/checkily/tree/main/chess) library containing the logic of chess (board representation and move generation).
- [`engine`](https://github.com/nikolausrauch/checkily/tree/main/engine) the checkily library (and UCI capable executable) containing the engine
- [`gui`]() a SMFL based graphical user interface to play against any engine supporting UCI

> For examples and usage of executables check the README in the respective folders.
