<h1 align="center">chess_gui</h1>

**chess_gui** is chess graphical user interface written in C++ based on SFML.   
I implemented it specifically to test and play against **checkily**, but it should be able to interface all uci capable engines. 

> **The gui is currently under development and is not feature complete.**
